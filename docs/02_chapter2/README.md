# Frontend webdesign

A website consists of a structure (what is on the page) made in HTML and styling (how and where is something on the page) done in CSS. In this form the web page is static, so there is no change due to interaction or data changes.

## Developmenttools

Because HTML is actually just text, you can use your favorite text editor such as Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Brackets, ... for this. Some of those editors also offer a 'live preview' which is very useful while you are designing your page.

We use Visual Studio Code to build our projects. If it is not already installed on your system, go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the version for your system. 

After installation you also add the live server extension. For more information on how to do this, see the [Visual Studio Code User's Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).

## Webstructure with HTML

The structure of a web page is created using HTML, which is the standard **markup language** for creating web pages. HTML stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. It describes the structure of a web page based on HTML elements that tell the browser how the page content is structured.

HTML elements, also called **tags**, are like containers. They tell something about the information inside their **opening tag** and **closing tag**.

Let's take a closer look at one such tag:

```html
<a href="https://www.vives.be">Visit VIVES</a>
```

* `<a>` is the **opening tag**
* `href` is the **attribute name**
* `"https://www.vives.be"` is the **attribute value**
* `</a>` is the **closing tag**
